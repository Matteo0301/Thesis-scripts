# Thesis-scripts
## Introduction
This repository contains the scripts developed for my internship and that are
the basis of my thesis. The scripts are written in Bash and aim to automate
the process of scanning a device for known vulnerabilities, with as little interaction as possible.

## Documentation
The documentation about how to use each script and what dependencies are needed can be found in the links below:
- [Network scanner](./scan.md)
- [Host discovery](./find_hosts.md)
- [Packet sniffer](./sniff.md)
