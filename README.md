# Thesis-scripts
## Introduction
This repository contains the scripts developed for my internship and that are
the basis of my thesis. The scripts are written in Bash and aim to automate
the process of scanning a device for known vulnerabilities, with as little interaction as possible. All scripts require root privileges to run. The requirements should be installed by default on a Kali Linux machine and on other security focused distributions, but they are reported for
completeness.

## Documentation
The documentation about how to use each script, how they work and what dependencies are needed can be found in the links below:
